Breaking up with my girlfriend has taught me that music is a waste of fucking time.
As much as that may hurt to hear for someone, and as heartbreaking it is for me to say, I *am* thankful to have this realization.
Now I can focus on what's important, and right now that's digging myself out of this rut.

I loved learning music theory, the tactility of playing what I was learning on piano, and seeing how it applied to guitar.
What I did not enjoy was practicing, and unfortunately, that's where most of the gains are to be had if you are to share that experience with another person.
I am an adult in my mid-20's; I don't have the time nor the plasticity in my brain to pick up what I want to play into muscle memory in the time frame that I would like.
Sure I can play very simple songs, basic chord progressions, or stumble through harder material on piano, but the number of hours I would need to sink into practicing to play what I *really* want to play would be *years*.

Here's the thing: I can spend an hour everyday practicing piano for the next N years to get marginally good to be able to play with other people, but I would rather spend that time somewhere else.
And I don't think an hour is sufficient for me to soak up the information at the rate I want.
But if I practice less than that, then the gains are too small and the practicing becomes meaningless due to time constraints.
And if I quit like I'm doing now, then all of the hours are lost.

On the other hand, I can now hopefully use this time to sharpen up my resume, improve my career, and work on projects that are lasting and meaningful.
Basically doing anything I can to get out of here, *then* using the time I will have to do what I love even more than music, which is playing outdoors.

Keep in mind that when I say music in this context, it pretty much means playing piano live and playing what's in my head, and being able to share that experience with someone.
There is always playing chords on the guitar too, but that's never satisfying, personally, due to how repetitive and mindless the playing is, and how illogically the guitar is set up to learn music theory.
Maybe I'll return in the future making music, since that has less to do with playing in real time.

That being said, I will always love listening to music, and I definitely won't forget the parts I've learned cerebrally.
